# es-scrape
 A Web Scraper that Explores ESM Code


The intention for this repository is to use my [remote-esm](https://github.com/garrettmflynn/remote-esm) to search through the ESM content of a webpageâ€”looking for key patterns.

We will follow [this](https://www.scrapingbee.com/blog/web-scraping-javascript/) tutorial to implement a solution in Node.js.
